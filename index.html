				<h2>A history of us </h2>
				<h2>chapter 1 - Hello Facebook</h2>
				<em>July 6, 2015</em>
				
				<p>	
					I add Jessie to facebook.  Jessie: "Thanks for adding me!", Jerry: "hello! No worries, I haven't been very active on fb so needed to catch up.  Thus, it began from a possible bot from okcupid to real deal person on fb. lol.</p>
					
				<p>
					The first few conversations were spent while I was in toronto visiting my dad, and Jessie's was finishing off at Edelman, about to start her new job at Invivo. The "vetting" process began..(what we are looking for, what we did for a living, what were our thoughts on this and that) during those fb messages. 
				</p>
				<p>
					
					A few days later, we had our first skype conversation, and we took a picture. 
					A lot of laughing was had during the conversation, mostly by Jessie.  At one point the skype video froze, in which a good 5-10 minutes of the conversation, she just had just a frozen picture of Jerry while he made funny voices.

				<h2>First Date</h2>
				<em>July 27, 2015</em>
				<p>	
					First date with Jessie.  I was back in Montreal.  We went to big in japan bar.  Jessie was wearing a nice dress.  We talked a little about their childhood (Jessie use to put on a lot of plays as a kid, and studied theatre).  Little did I know but Jessie was starving, and after I was taking my sweet time drinking my second beer, she mentioned going to eat somewhere nearby...like now..lol.  We had some eats at patti pattata. I walked her to the park where her bus was nearby.  We sat for a bit, and chatted.  Before Jessie left for her bus, we kissed.  I was super smooth.  Not.

				<em>August 04, 2015</em>
				<p>	
					After texting each other, saying how much of a nice time we had, we went on another date a week later.  At jessie's suggestion was saw a documentary at cinema du parc, Cars vs. Bikes. After the movie, we walked back to my apartment, where his roomate was having a celebratory party for one of her colleagues. Lots of people there, it was a pleasant evening all around.

				<p>	
					At this point, I had met Jordan and Dominique, and also Jessie's parents.  (Unfortunately the exact dates were not certain).  I remember hearing good things about this place and so we went to eat here, the second time I had spent time with Jordan and Dominique with Jessie.  The first time we went to a bar to watch the montreal canadiens (not jessie's suggestion.lol).  The nice thing is Jordan and Dominique speak to me often in english, which helps my brain.

She walked in quite surprised, but earlier she saw in shalaka's window people setting up when she walked out of the metro.  LOL.  It was a pleasant evening, I hadn't met PA who was there, and I heard  all their old gang's old stories fo their times together.

				<h2>Strom Spa</h2>

				<p>	
					Strom Spa with Jessie.  Courtesy of Jessie's parents giving us a nice christmas gift.  It was one of the relaxing evenings ever.  We did the hot baths, then scandanavian cold baths (well, me), and we also took a massage together.  A very pleasant experience and am glad we shared it together.  At this point, Jessie knows I'm a bit of a grumpy guss in person on the daily, despite my happy go lucky vibes in public.  And She's been super understanding about that. There is something about having a hot bath then going into a cold bath that feels super relaxing on the body after.  It's akin to meditation almost, you feel very peaceful and centered. (without the hard work lol)

				<p>	
					I was being very grumpy grump about wanting to do anything on my birthday, (i feel part of it was i hadn't really kept in touch with anyone the last few months..) but I was glad to do something small this year with just Jessie and me. Spent the day just the two of us in old port, then went to juniors filipino resto. I'd never really gone to any filipino restaurants in Montreal, but this one, in St. Henri was quite good, they added their own extra touches to traditional filipino dishes.

					Went to a "fancy" sugar shack. Another selfie. LOL.  Ok so going to sugar shack with Jessie's family and uncle and aunt's was pretty nice, they are always super nice to me, but the sugar shack was ...disappointing. The host/owner was very, theatrical shall we say... After the first meal which was impressive (some soup) the subsequent dishes left a lot to be desired and didn't seem to be very generous in terms of portions. Still, a good adventure in Jerry never been to this part of quebec times.

					A lot of nice moments this weekend.  Jessie found a super nice airbnb near little Italy.  It was her first time in that area and we had a great time exploring the area, and had a great time being near Kensington Market, china town, spadina.  I met Tracy and Jared for the first time and we had a nice dinner together. The airbnb really felt like a hotel, it was very well maintained.
				</p>
				<p> 
					We also discovered a "hidden" park in the city, the brickworks. Inside they had a farmers market and some paths to work off that good farmers market food.
				</p>
				<p>
				  Plus, Jessie meets my family!  It's the first time I've brought anyone to toronto to meet my parents.  So it was pretty big deal. It went very well and she got to also meet the cutie pie kiddies Selena and TJ.

					QC city weekend!  Jessie found another nice airbnb and we stayed there for the weekend and we met Jessie's friend Josiane and her new baby. I had met josiane and her partner one time when they were in Montreal.  I hadn't been to quebec city in years, and not so much when the weather was nice.  Old quebec is a really beautiful city.  On our first night there jessie chose this nice restaurant which had gotten some good reviews (I forget the name but sweetie you'll remind me right?).  We spent the next day walking around the city with the tourists, and we happened upon this nice bar that had chairs in the water, what a nice idea!  We had dinner at Josiane's later that day with some home cooked pizza. Was delicious!

Sweetie was nice enough to get the ingredients, so i was able to make it right when I got home.  Jordan also brought out a delicous appetizer we had before the main course. The risotto turned out well and the family was happy, and I was forgiven lol.

				<p>	
					For the birthday weekend, Jessie got a good deal (anyone noticing a pattern here? All good stuff that happened was because jessie finds good stuff) and we went to Fairmont hotel in Montebello. The larget log cabin in North America ('tis true!).  We had a lovely time there, the nice restaurant, the amazing indoor pool, the nice trails and walks, the local pub food.  Plus it was christmas season so there were lights all over, just super cozy.  A highlight of our time this year.
